      "Structure: Bowman's capsule → PCT → Loop of Henle (descending thin, ascending thick) → DCT → collecting duct",
      "Ascending limb pumps Na⁺Cl⁻ out (impermeable to water) → medulla hyper-osmotic",
      "Descending limb loses water to hyper-medulla",
      "Multiplies gradient → collecting duct reabsorbs water under ADH",
      "Results in concentrated urine production"

    question: "Explain primary and secondary growth in woody dicots, emphasising the activities of apical meristems, vascular cambium, and cork cambium, and relate these to annual ring formation.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Primary (length): apical meristems produce protoderm, procambium, ground meristem",
      "Tissues differentiate into epidermis, primary xylem/phloem, cortex",
      "Vascular cambium adds secondary xylem (wood) inwards, secondary phloem outwards",
      "Annual rings (earlywood vs latewood)",
      "Cork cambium (phellogen) generates phellem (cork) and phelloderm → forms bark",
      "Advantages: mechanical support, conduction capacity"
    ],
